This is a simple application that calculates pi in a multithreaded fashion by 
sampling points inside of the unit square and determining if they land in the 
unit circle.  It was just an opportunity for me to experiment with C++11's 
threading capabilities.

For installation instructions, see INSTALL.

Once compiled, you can run `threadedpi --help` to see available options:

    $ ./threadedpi --help
    Threaded Pi

    Allowed options:
      -h [ --help ]            print help message
      -s [ --num_samples ] arg number of samples per thread
      -t [ --num_threads ] arg number of threads

In short, the command `threadedpi -s 1000000 -t 4` will execute the program,
using four threads and sampling one million points in each thread.  The 
approximation to pi will be recorded:

    $ ./threadedpi -s 1000000 -t 4
