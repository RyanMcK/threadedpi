Requirements
    * A C++11 compliant compiler.
    * Boost C++ libraries.  Any version with Program Options and 
      Unit Test Framework should be okay.  Version 1.53.0 is recommended.
    * CMake, version >= 2.8.
    * (Optional) Doxygen, for producing documentation.

Installation Instructions
    CMake will attempt to autolocate Boost and (if available) Doxygen.  The
    simplest installation steps are

    git clone git://github.com/RyanMcK/threadedpi.git
    cd threadedpi
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

    This will produce the directory `bin` in the build folder containing the 
    binaries threadedpi and test_threadedpi.

    Additionally, you may type `make test` to run unit tests and (if Doxygen
    is installed) `make doc` to produce documentation in the directory `doc`.
